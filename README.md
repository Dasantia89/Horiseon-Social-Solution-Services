HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

In this project, the website for Horiseon Social Solution Services was refactored to follow html and css best practices. I learned to use semantic html elements when possible, make sure every image has alternate text, make sure a website has a descriptive title, and to consolidate css selectors when possible.
